Hi, I'm Junoh Heo and a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io). My research interests include *computer experiments, multi-fidelity simulation, and uncertainty quantification, with applications in the physical, biological, and engineering sciences*.

**I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market and would be glad to discuss any opportunities.**
