Hi, I'm Junoh Heo and Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io). My research interests include **computer experiment, uncertainty quantification, multi-fidelity simulation** in the field of *industrial/engineering statistics*.
