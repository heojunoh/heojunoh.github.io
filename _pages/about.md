Hi, I'm Junoh Heo and a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Probability](https://stt.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Chih-Li Sung](https://chihli.github.io). My research interests include **computer experiment, uncertainty quantification, multi-fidelity simulation** in the field of *industrial/engineering statistics*.\
Besides research, my personal favorites are Pok√©mon GO, Manchester City, Kiha Chang, and sushi.\
I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market and would be glad to discuss any opportunities starting after May 2025. Please feel free to reach out to me!
